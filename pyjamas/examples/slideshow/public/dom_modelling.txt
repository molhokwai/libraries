 * DOM Modelling is the key to a successful easy widget set
   ** Browser technology tolerant of poor layout, for two decades
   ** Rules regarding "repaint" well established

   ** Text, markup, fonts, SVG (2D), plugins, buttons, blah blah
   ** you just gotta access it!
 * Option A: Webkit
   ** Didn't have a free-software DOM manipulator
   ** (it does now)
 * Option B: Python-KDE3
   ** Grand-daddy of Webkit!
   ** PyKHTML
