This is the source code to the Pyjamas showcase.

Before compiling it, you need to modify the compile.py module and set the
PATH_TO_PYJAMAS variable to the path to your Pyjamas installation (relative to
the directory in which compile.py is placed).  Then type:

    python compile.py

If you have any problems or questions, you can either post to the pyjamas
mailing list, or contact me directly at ewestra [at] gmail [dot] com.

Feel free to borrow any code you wish from the showcase, for any purpose you
like.  I hope you find it helpful.

If you find bugs, etc, please let me know.
